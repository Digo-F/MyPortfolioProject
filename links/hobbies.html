                <p>I like to spend most of my time trying to learn programming or writing down 
                    every code that comes to my mind.  I enjoy the problem solving that lies underneath 
                    it and I enjoy creating applications (especially Web applications) very time. Even if
                    I'm not an expert on it I will atleast try to understand the basic syntax and functions of the language.</p>
                <h3>Some of the programming languages I know are:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>C++</li>
                    <li>Pyhton</li>
                    <li>Javascript</li>

                <p>I would like to begin with famous quote: "Some people think football is a matter of life and death. I assure you, it's 
                    much more serious than that." ~ Bill Shankly</p>
                <p>Football is definitely a very good sport to enjoy, the reason why I love football is I forget all my stress, 
                    all depressing thoughts, and all worries when I play or watch football. It's like meditation and helps me relax. 
                    The other reason is it is such an emotional game. I feel some sort of attachment to the club and the players I follow.</p>

                    <p>Reading develops our brains and gives us the ability to understand life in a much better fashion. Besides, there's a 
                        lot of room for grammar and language development. When you read a lot, you learn new words all the time. I read books 
                        primarily to learn, grow, and feed my curiosities and love for good stories. This means that I mostly read non-fiction 
                        books about great people, lifestyle, and business/marketing, and then, of course, there's a great deal of multi-genre reading.
                        While I certainly learn a lot through academics, I for a fact know that books are a gateway to deeper knowledge.
                        There is nothing like getting lost in a book to make time fly. You can be in a different world other than the real one.
                        You can always learn something new by reading books.</p>
